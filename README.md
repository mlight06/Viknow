# Viknow
MVP Project

## Overview
Viknow is an MVP-based application. It will be able to persist data that is both imported, and input by the user. This is a solo project that was done in a 48 hour period.

## Description
Viknow is a full stack application that will allow the user to select from a wide, and ever growing database of dish types. Based on the selection, the most palatable type of wine(s) will be suggested to pair. A description of the selected wine will be provided to inform the user what to expect from such a wine.
